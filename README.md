# odin-rock-paper-scissors
An implementation of grade-school classic for a web browser.

## The purpose
This project will put to the test my foundational knowledge of JavaScript. I will practice using if-statements, logical operators, loops, creating functions, returning values from those functions, and performing simple mathematical operations.

I will also improve the most important skill any developer can have: problem-solving.
